  abstract = {We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control
policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement
learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant
of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function
estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from
the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or
learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six
of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.},

@ARTICLE{browne12,
  ABSTRACT = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithmâ€™s derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},
